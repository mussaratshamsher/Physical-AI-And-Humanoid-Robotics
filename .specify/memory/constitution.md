# Phase- 1 
 # [Project]
Name: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" Type: "AI-Native Textbook"

# [Purpose]
The primary purpose of this project is to create a short, clean, and professional AI-Native textbook based on the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course. The textbook must serve as a fast, simple, and high-quality learning resource, presented through a modern and customized Docusaurus user interface.

# [Scope]
The project scope is defined by the following components:

# Content:
A concise textbook consisting of six chapters:

1- Introduction to Physical AI
2- Basics of Humanoid Robotics
3- ROS 2 Fundamentals
4- Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo + Isaac)
5- Vision-Language-Action Systems
6- Capstone: Simple AI-Robot Pipeline
## User Interface:
A clean, minimalist, and professional UI built on Docusaurus.
The design should prioritize readability and ease of navigation.
Technical Specifications:
**Deployment**: The final textbook will be deployed on Vercel.
**Embeddings**: The project will use lightweight or minimal embeddings to stay within free-tier limitations.
**Translation**: Optional support for Urdu translation and other personalization features may be explored if time and resources permit.
[Core Principles]
All work on this project must adhere to the following principles:

**Simplicity**: Prioritize clarity and conciseness in both content and design. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
**Accuracy**: Ensure all technical information is correct, up-to-date, and well-researched.
**Minimalism**: Keep the design, features, and dependencies to a minimum to ensure a lightweight and focused experience.
**Fast Builds**: Optimize the development process and technology stack for rapid build and deployment cycles.
[Key Features]
## Docusaurus-based textbook structure.
Seamless deployment and continuous integration with Vercel.
A modern, customized UI for an enhanced reading experience.
Optional features for personalization, such as Urdu translation.
# [Constraints]
**No Heavy GPU Usage**: The final product and development workflow must not require heavy GPU resources.
**Minimal Embeddings**: Keep the use of embeddings to a minimum to align with the principle of minimalism and free-tier compatibility.
**Free-Tier Friendly**: All technologies and services used should ideally fit within free-tier plans to minimize costs.
# [Success Criteria]
The project will be considered successful upon meeting the following criteria:

**Build Success**: The Docusaurus project builds without errors.
**Clean UI**: The final textbook has a polished, professional, and uncluttered user interface.
Smooth Vercel Deployment: The project is successfully and smoothly deployed to a public Vercel URL.
**Content Completion**: All six chapters are written and published.
# [Style and Conventions]
**Code**: Adhere to standard formatting and linting rules for JavaScript/TypeScript and React. Maintain a clean and organized codebase.
**Content**: Write in a clear, professional, and accessible tone suitable for a technical textbook. Use Markdown for all content.
**UI**: The UI should be modern, responsive, and consistent with the minimalist aesthetic.
[Tools and Technologies]
**Framework**: Docusaurus
**Deployment**: Vercel
**Simulation (for content)**: Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim
Robotics Framework (for content): ROS 2
# [Deployment Strategy]
**Source Control**: All code will be hosted in a GitHub repository.
**Continuous Deployment** (CI/CD): Vercel will be connected to the GitHub repository. Any push or merge to the main branch will automatically trigger a new build and deployment on Vercel.
**Domain**: The final textbook will be accessible via a Vercel-provided URL (.vercel.app).
