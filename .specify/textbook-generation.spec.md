# Feature: AI-Native Textbook UI & Layout

## 1. Objective
To define a complete specification for building the interactive UI and layout for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" AI-native textbook. This specification will guide the creation of a clean, modern, and easy-to-navigate Docusaurus-based website.

## 2. Book Structure
The textbook will be organized into the following six chapters. The file structure should reflect this hierarchy to enable automatic sidebar generation.

- **`docs/`**
  - **`01-intro-to-physical-ai/`**
    - `_category_.json`
    - `index.md`
  - **`02-basics-of-humanoid-robotics/`**
    - `_category_.json`
    - `index.md`
  - **`03-ros2-fundamentals/`**
    - `_category_.json`
    - `index.md`
  - **`04-digital-twin-simulation/`**
    - `_category_.json`
    - `index.md`
  - **`05-vision-language-action-systems/`**
    - `_category_.json`
    - `index.md`
  - **`06-capstone-project/`**
    - `_category_.json`
    - `index.md`
  - **`intro.md`** (Landing page for the documentation section)

## 3. Technical & Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Core Framework
- **Technology:** The website will be built using **Docusaurus**.

### 3.2. Homepage Layout
The homepage (`src/pages/index.tsx`) will consist of two main parts:
1.  **Hero Section:** A standard Docusaurus hero banner at the top, configured in `docusaurus.config.js`.
2.  **Chapter Cards:** Below the hero section, display a grid of six cards. This will be implemented as a `FeatureCard` React component.
    -   **Component:** `src/components/FeatureCard.tsx`
    -   **Props:** The component will accept `title`, `link`, and `description`.
    -   **Display:** On the homepage, each card will render the chapter **title in bold** and a brief description.
    -   **Link:** Each card will link to its corresponding chapter (e.g., `/docs/intro-to-physical-ai`).

### 3.3. Navigation
- **Sidebar:** The documentation sidebar must be automatically generated from the directory structure in `docs/` using Docusaurus's autogenerated sidebar feature.
- **Top Navigation:** The main navigation bar should include a link to the "Textbook" section, pointing to `/docs/intro`.

### 3.4. Build and Deployment
- **`docusaurus.config.js`:** This file must be configured with the correct `organizationName`, `projectName`, and `url` for the target GitHub repository.
- **`vercel.json`:** A `vercel.json` file will be created to define the build command (`npm run build`) and output directory (`build`) for Vercel, ensuring correct deployment.
- **GitHub Workflow (Optional but Recommended):** A basic GitHub Actions workflow file can be added at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to log deployment activities, although Vercel's native GitHub integration will handle the trigger.

## 4. Optional Features (Post-MVP)

### 4.1. Internationalization (i18n)
- **Urdu Translation:** Implement Docusaurus's i18n system to support an optional Urdu translation of the content.
- A language switcher should be added to the navigation bar.

## 5. Success Criteria
- A functional Docusaurus website is successfully built and can be run locally.
- The homepage correctly displays a hero section followed by six chapter cards.
- Each chapter card displays the chapter title in bold and links to the correct documentation page.
- The sidebar is automatically generated and correctly reflects the six-chapter structure.
- The project builds without any errors (`npm run build`).
