# Chapter 01: What is Physical AI?
## An Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to Physical Artificial Intelligence. This chapter introduces how AI interacts with the physical world through embodiment, perception, reasoning, and action.

## 1.1 What is Physical AI?

Physical AI systems are embodied in physical forms, perceiving, reasoning, and interacting with the real world in real-time. Unlike traditional AI, they create a feedback loop: perceive via sensors, reason with algorithms, act via actuators, and repeat.

> Example: A robot vacuum uses sensors to navigate and clean, adjusting based on obstacles.

## 1.2 Difference between Traditional AI and Physical AI

Traditional AI processes data digitally, while Physical AI performs physical actions.

| Feature | Traditional AI | Physical AI |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Environment | Digital/simulated | Physical world |
| Input | Static datasets | Real-time sensors |
| Output | Information | Actions |
| Goal | Analysis | Task completion |
| Challenges | Bias, scalability | Safety, real-time |

## 1.3 Core Components of Physical AI Systems

Four components: Embodiment (body), Perception (sensors), Reasoning (AI brain), Action (actuators).

## 1.4 Role of Sensors and Actuators

Sensors: Exteroceptive (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, IMUs) for environment; Proprioceptive (e.g., encoders, force sensors) for body state.

Actuators: Motors (electric, hydraulic), grippers for movement and manipulation.

## 1.5 Physical AI in Robotics and Humanoids

Robotics embodies Physical AI. Humanoids operate in human environments, requiring advanced dexterity.

> Example: Climbing stairs involves perceiving steps, planning movements, and executing with balance.

## 1.6 Real-world Applications

- Autonomous vehicles and drones
- Manufacturing robots
- Healthcare robots
- Exploration drones

## 1.7 Benefits and Challenges

Benefits: Automation, efficiency, safety in hazardous tasks.

Challenges: Sim-to-real gap, safety, hardware limits, real-time decisions.

### Case Study: Amazon Robotics

Amazon uses autonomous robots for warehouse logistics, perceiving via floor markers, reasoning centrally, acting to move shelves. This boosts efficiency and safety.
